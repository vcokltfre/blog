[{"body":"I get asked how I'm supposed to pronounce my name a lot, and the story behind it, so here it is.\nFirst, pronunciation: each letter, said one after another, v-c-o-k-l-t-f-r-e.\nNext, the backstory: although it looks random it's less random than it seems, although it is still, to an extent, random. The letters are actually grouped together on a normal qwerty keyboard, vc okl tfre are all near eachother. That's all the backstory. It's not an elaborate joke of some sort, as much as I'd like that, just simply random-but-not-that-random letters.\n","link":"https://blog.vcokltfre.dev/name/","title":"The Name"},{"body":"vcokltfre's blog Hey! Welcome to my blog site, here I occasionally post updates and information about things I'm interested in, usually technology related!\nWho am I? I'm a software developer from the UK, usually creating Discord bots, APIs, and generally other random backend services. I use Python for the majority of my projects, and FastAPI for the APIs, and for making Discord bots I use discord.py, and have made a tutorial about how to use it here.\nI moderate a few Discord servers, and develop bots for some of them, including Minecraft@Home and GTA Online.\nSome slightly notable things I've made, or helped to make:\n My discord.py tutorial Magoji Bot ResearchBot MessageSafe  ","link":"https://blog.vcokltfre.dev/","title":"vcokltfre's blog"}]
