[{"body":"vcokltfre's blog Hey! Welcome to my blog site, here I occasionally post updates and information about things I'm interested in, usually technology related!\nWho am I? I'm a software developer from the UK, usually creating Discord bots, APIs, and generally other random backend services. I use Python for the majority of my projects, and FastAPI for the APIs, and for making Discord bots I use discord.py, and have made a tutorial about how to use it here.\nI moderate a few Discord servers, and develop bots for some of them, including Minecraft@Home and GTA Online.\nSome slightly notable things I've made, or helped to make:\n My discord.py tutorial Magoji Bot ResearchBot MessageSafe  ","link":"https://blog.vcokltfre.dev/","title":"vcokltfre's blog"}]
