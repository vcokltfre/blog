# vcokltfre's blog

Hey! Welcome to my blog site, here I occasionally post updates and information about things I'm interested in, usually technology related!

## Who am I?

I'm a software developer from the UK, usually creating Discord bots, APIs, and generally other random backend services. I use Python for the majority of my projects, and FastAPI for the APIs. For making Discord bots I use discord.py, and have made a tutorial about how to use it [here.](https://vcokltfre.dev)

I moderate a few Discord servers, and develop bots for some of them, including [Minecraft@Home](https://mcatho.me) and GTA Online.

Some slightly notable things I've made, or helped to make:

- [My discord.py tutorial](https://github.com/vcokltfre/tutorial)
- [Magoji Bot](https://github.com/vcokltfre/Magoji)
- [ResearchBot](https://github.com/vcokltfre/ResearchBot3)
- [MessageSafe](https://github.com/vcokltfre/messagesafe)
