I get asked how I'm supposed to pronounce my name a lot, and the story behind it, so here it is.

First, pronunciation: each letter, said one after another, v-c-o-k-l-t-f-r-e.

Next, the backstory: although it looks random it's less random than it seems, although it is still, to an extent, random. The letters are actually grouped together on a normal qwerty keyboard, `vc` `okl` `tfre` are all near eachother. That's all the backstory. It's not an elaborate joke of some sort, as much as I'd like that, just simply random-but-not-that-random letters.
